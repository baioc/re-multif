    abstract = {Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are a versatile language for describing the dynamical behaviour of chemical kinetics, capable of modelling a variety of digital and analogue processes. While CRN designs for synchronous sequential logic circuits have been proposed and their implementation in DNA demonstrated, a physical realisation of these devices is difficult because of their reliance on a clock. Asynchronous sequential logic, on the other hand, does not require a clock, and instead relies on handshaking protocols to ensure the temporal ordering of different phases of the computation. This paper provides novel CRN designs for the construction of asynchronous logic, arithmetic and control flow elements based on a bi-molecular reaction motif with catalytic reactions and uniform reaction rates. We model and validate the designs for the deterministic and stochastic semantics using Microsoft's GEC tool and the probabilistic model checker PRISM, demonstrating their ability to emulate the function of asynchronous components under low molecular count.},

    abstract = {Advances in the field of synthetic biology have been key to demonstration of molecular computing systems in general and DNA in particular. This paper presents an overview of how continuous-time, discrete-time, and digital signal processing systems can be implemented using molecular reactions and DNA. In this paper, discrete-time systems refer to sampled signals with continuous signal amplitude. Signals that are sampled in discrete time steps with digital amplitude are referred to as digital signals. Delay elements in sampled signals are implemented using molecular reactions in the form of molecular transfer reactions. Completion of all phases of transfer reactions once corresponds to a computation cycle. These molecular systems can be implemented in a fully-synchronous, globally-synchronous locally-asynchronous or fully-asynchronous manner. The paper also presents molecular sensing systems where molecular reactions are used to implement analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs). Molecular implementations of digital logic systems are presented. A complete example of the addition of two molecules using digital implementation is described where the concentrations of two molecules are converted to digital by two 3-bit ADCs, and the 4-bit output of the digital adder is converted to analog by a 4-bit DAC. This system is demonstrated using both molecular reactions and DNA. A brief comparison of molecular and electronic systems is also presented.},

    abstract = {Early synthetic biology designs, namely the genetic toggle switch and repressilator, showed that regulatory components can be characterized and assembled to bring about complex, electronics-inspired behaviours in living systems (for example, memory storage and timekeeping).Through the characterization and assembly of genetic parts and biological building blocks, many more devices have been constructed, including switches, memory elements, oscillators, pulse generators, digital logic gates, filters and communication modules.Advances in the field are now allowing expansion beyond small gene networks to the realm of larger biological programs, which hold promise for a wide range of applications, including biosensing, therapeutics and the production of biofuels, pharmaceuticals and biomaterials.Synthetic biosensing circuits consist of sensitive elements that bind analytes and transducer modules that mobilize cellular responses. Balancing these two modules involves engineering modularity and specificity into the various circuits.Biosensor sensitive elements include environment-responsive promoters (transcriptional), RNA aptamers (translational) and protein receptors (post-translational).Biosensor transducer modules include engineered gene networks (transcriptional), non-coding regulatory RNAs (translational) and protein signal-transduction circuits (post-translational).The contributions of synthetic biology to therapeutics include: engineered networks and organisms for disease-mechanism elucidation, drug-target identification, drug-discovery platforms, therapeutic treatment, therapeutic delivery, and drug production and access.In the microbial production of biofuels and pharmaceuticals, synthetic biology has supplemented traditional genetic and metabolic engineering efforts by aiding the construction of optimized biosynthetic pathways.Optimizing metabolic flux through biosynthetic pathways is traditionally accomplished by driving the expression of pathway enzymes with strong, inducible promoters. New synthetic approaches include the rapid diversification of various pathway components, the rational and model-guided assembly of pathway components, and hybrid solutions.},

    abstract = {Synthetic biology has enabled the creation of biological reconfigurable circuits, which perform multiple functions monopolizing a single biological machine; Such a system can switch between different behaviours in response to environmental cues. Previous work has demonstrated switchable dynamical behaviour employing reconfigurable logic gate genetic networks. Here we describe a computational framework for reconfigurable circuits in E.coli using combinations of logic gates, and also propose the biological implementation. The proposed system is an oscillator that can exhibit tunability of frequency and amplitude of oscillations. Further, the frequency of operation can be changed optogenetically. Insilico analysis revealed that two-component light systems, in response to light within a frequency range, can be used for modulating the frequency of the oscillator or stopping the oscillations altogether. Computational modelling reveals that mixing two colonies of E.coli oscillating at different frequencies generates spatial beat patterns. Further, we show that these oscillations more robustly respond to input perturbations compared to the base oscillator, to which the proposed oscillator is a modification. Compared to the base oscillator, the proposed system shows faster synchronization in a colony of cells for a larger region of the parameter space. Additionally, the proposed oscillator also exhibits lesser synchronization error in the transient period after input perturbations. This provides a strong basis for the construction of synthetic reconfigurable circuits in bacteria and other organisms, which can be scaled up to perform functions in the field of time dependent drug delivery with tunable dosages, and sets the stage for further development of circuits with synchronized population level behaviour.},

Analysis of the bifurcation structure also reveals novel, programmable multi-functionality; in addition to functioning as a frequency multiplier, the network is able to function as a switch or an oscillator, depending on the temporal nature of the input. Multi-functionality is often observed in neuronal networks, where it is suggested to allow for the efficient coordination of different responses. This network represents a significant theoretical addition that extends the capabilities of synthetic gene networks.},

In the renowned literature, biological gates and genetic oscillator have been unveiled and experimentally realized in recent years. These biological circuits have formed a basis for realizing a primitive biocomputer. In the traditional computer architecture, there is an intermediate load-store section, i.e. a register, which serves as a part of the digital processor. With which, the processor can load data from a larger memory into it and proceed to conduct necessary arithmetic or logic operations. Then, manipulated data are stored back to the memory by instruction via the register. We propose here a class of bio-registers for the biocomputer. Four types of register structures are presented. In silicon experiments illustrate results of the proposed design.},

This research develops a new genetic clock generator based on a genetic oscillator, in which, a sine wave generator is adopted as a signal oscillator. It is shown that combination of a genetic oscillator with a toggle switch is able to generate clock signals forming an efficient way to generate a near square wave. In silico study confirms the proposed idea.},

Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational network design may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},
