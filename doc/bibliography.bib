    abstract = {Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are a versatile language for describing the dynamical behaviour of chemical kinetics, capable of modelling a variety of digital and analogue processes. While CRN designs for synchronous sequential logic circuits have been proposed and their implementation in DNA demonstrated, a physical realisation of these devices is difficult because of their reliance on a clock. Asynchronous sequential logic, on the other hand, does not require a clock, and instead relies on handshaking protocols to ensure the temporal ordering of different phases of the computation. This paper provides novel CRN designs for the construction of asynchronous logic, arithmetic and control flow elements based on a bi-molecular reaction motif with catalytic reactions and uniform reaction rates. We model and validate the designs for the deterministic and stochastic semantics using Microsoft's GEC tool and the probabilistic model checker PRISM, demonstrating their ability to emulate the function of asynchronous components under low molecular count.},

    abstract = {Advances in the field of synthetic biology have been key to demonstration of molecular computing systems in general and DNA in particular. This paper presents an overview of how continuous-time, discrete-time, and digital signal processing systems can be implemented using molecular reactions and DNA. In this paper, discrete-time systems refer to sampled signals with continuous signal amplitude. Signals that are sampled in discrete time steps with digital amplitude are referred to as digital signals. Delay elements in sampled signals are implemented using molecular reactions in the form of molecular transfer reactions. Completion of all phases of transfer reactions once corresponds to a computation cycle. These molecular systems can be implemented in a fully-synchronous, globally-synchronous locally-asynchronous or fully-asynchronous manner. The paper also presents molecular sensing systems where molecular reactions are used to implement analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs). Molecular implementations of digital logic systems are presented. A complete example of the addition of two molecules using digital implementation is described where the concentrations of two molecules are converted to digital by two 3-bit ADCs, and the 4-bit output of the digital adder is converted to analog by a 4-bit DAC. This system is demonstrated using both molecular reactions and DNA. A brief comparison of molecular and electronic systems is also presented.},

    abstract = {We present the design and analysis of a synthetic gene network that performs frequency multiplication. It takes oscillatory transcription factor concentrations, such as those produced from the currently available genetic oscillators, as an input, and produces oscillations with half the input frequency as an output. Analysis of the bifurcation structure also reveals novel, programmable multi-functionality; in addition to functioning as a frequency multiplier, the network is able to function as a switch or an oscillator, depending on the temporal nature of the input. Multi-functionality is often observed in neuronal networks, where it is suggested to allow for the efficient coordination of different responses. This network represents a significant theoretical addition that extends the capabilities of synthetic gene networks.},

    abstract = {Networks of interacting biomolecules carry out many essential functions in living cells1, but the ‘design principles’ underlying the functioning of such intracellular networks remain poorly understood, despite intensive efforts including quantitative analysis of relatively simple systems2. Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock3,4,5 to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such ‘rational network design’ may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

A clock signal is a periodic square wave, its amplitude alternates at a steady frequency between fixed minimal and maximal levels. Transition between the minimum and the maximum is instantaneous for an ideal square wave; however, the function is unrealisable in physical bio-systems. This research develops a new genetic clock generator based on a genetic oscillator, in which, a sine wave generator is adopted as a signal oscillator. It is shown that combination of a genetic oscillator with a toggle switch is able to generate clock signals forming an efficient way to generate a near square wave. In silico study confirms the proposed idea.},
